# Backend

  At the `Backend` of this App, A `Nodejs` server is running, which manages all the `requests` and `responses` from the user. 
This App Uses Some Node_Modules in order to work properly which include:
- `Mongoose`
  - To make requests from the backend to MongoDB
- `cors`
    - allows a server to indicate any origins other than its own from which a browser should permit loading resources.
- `Express`
  - create a web-server
  - handles request and response
  - To connect Backend and Frontend.

# Database

We are using `MongoDB` for all its database needs. This App uses DB to:
